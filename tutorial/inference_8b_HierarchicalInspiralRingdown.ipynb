    "In tutorial 8 we saw how to do a ringdown analysis of some gravitational wave data using the gated Gaussian model, which used gating and in-painting to excise the pre-merger data. Here, we illustrate how to combine that with an inspiral model the excises the post-merger data. Doing a joint inspiral/ringdown analysis in this manner is necessary if one wishes to marginalize over the sky location and arrival time of a signal, as discussed in [arXiv:2312.15146](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15146). To accomplish this, we will use the [HierarchicalModel](https://pycbc.org/pycbc/latest/html/pycbc.inference.models.html#pycbc.inference.models.hierarchical.HierarchicalModel) in PyCBC."
